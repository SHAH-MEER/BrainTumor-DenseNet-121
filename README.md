# Brain Tumor Detection with DenseNet-121

üß† **Brain Tumor Classification System**

This Gradio application uses a DenseNet-121 deep learning model to detect and classify brain tumors from MRI scan images. The model can identify three different types of brain conditions with high accuracy.

## üéØ Model Performance

This DenseNet-121 model achieves **94% overall accuracy** on the test dataset:

| Class | Precision | Recall | F1-Score | Support |
|-------|-----------|--------|----------|---------|
| Brain Glioma | 100% | 93% | 97% | 198 |
| Brain Meningioma | 88% | 94% | 91% | 193 |
| Brain Tumor | 95% | 95% | 95% | 214 |
| **Overall Accuracy** | | | **94%** | **605** |

## üî¨ Classification Categories

The model can detect and classify three types of brain conditions:

1. **Brain Glioma** - A type of tumor that occurs in the brain and spinal cord
2. **Brain Meningioma** - A tumor that arises from the meninges (membranes surrounding the brain)
3. **Brain Tumor** - General brain tumor classification

## üöÄ How to Use

1. **Upload an MRI Image**: Click on the upload area or drag and drop your brain MRI scan
2. **Get Prediction**: The model will automatically analyze the image and provide:
   - Predicted class with confidence score
   - Probability distribution across all three categories
3. **View Results**: Results are displayed instantly with clear visualization
